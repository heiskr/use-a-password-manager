# Use a password manager

A password manager stores and organizes your passwords.

If you don't use a password manager you are probably:

- using the same or similar passwords on many sites
- using passwords that are too short
- using common passwords and patterns

A password manager will create a strong unique password for each website you use.

## Do one of these

### I want easy

- [1Password](https://1password.com/sign-up/) is $3/month for an individual or $5/month for a family.
  
### I want free

- [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/create-account.php) has a free account.

### I don't trust "the cloud"

- Download [KeePass](https://keepass.info/download.html).

## Two-factor authentication

After you have a password manager, enable two-factor authentication for:

- Your email account
- Your bank account
- Your social media accounts
