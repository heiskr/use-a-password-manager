# Use a password manager

- Do you use the _same or similar passwords on many sites_?
- Do you use passwords that are _less than 12 characters_?
- Do you use common passwords, such as `letmein` or `trustno1`? 
- Do you use a pattern to create passwords, such as `a1s2d3f4` or `147258369`?

If you do _any_ of these, attackers will be more likely to target you.

With a password manager, you can create and save a strong unique password for each website you use.

## Get a password manager

- **I want easy.** [1Password](https://1password.com/sign-up/) is $3/month for an individual or $5/month for a family.
- **I want free.** [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/create-account.php) has a free account.
- **I don't trust "the cloud".** Download [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/download/).

## Update your passwords

After you have a password manager, _update your password_ and _enable two-factor authentication_ for:

1. Your email account
2. Your bank account
3. Your social media accounts
