# Use a password manager

- Do you use the same or similar passwords on many sites?
- Do you use passwords that are less than 12 characters?
- Do you use common passwords, such as `letmein` or `trustno1`? 
- Do you use a pattern to create passwords, such as `a1s2d3f4` or `147258369`?

If you do any of these, attackers will be more likely to target you.

A password manager stores and organizes your passwords. A password manager will create a strong unique password for each website you use.

## Get a password manager

### I want free

### I don't trust "the cloud"

After you have a password manager, update your password and enable two-factor authentication for:

1. Your email account
2. Your bank account
