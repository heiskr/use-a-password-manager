# Use a password manager

- Do you use the same or similar passwords on many sites?
- Do you use passwords that are less than 12 characters?
- Do you use common passwords and patterns?

If you do any of these three behaviors, attackers will be more likely to target you.

A password manager stores and organizes your passwords. A password manager will create a strong unique password for each website you use.

## Do one of these

### I want easy

- [1Password](https://1password.com/sign-up/) is $3/month for an individual or $5/month for a family.
  
### I want free

- [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/create-account.php) has a free account.

### I don't trust "the cloud"

- Download [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/download/).

## Two-factor authentication

After you have a password manager, enable two-factor authentication for:

- Your email account
- Your bank account
- Your social media accounts
